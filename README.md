**Documentation for Simple Todo App**

---

### Overview

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of a Simple Todo App developed for the recruitment process for FTR. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, marking as completed, and deleting todos. It utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering, Redux for state management, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Redux Persist for storing data persistently.

### Features

1. **Add Todo**: Users can type in an input field to add a new todo task to the list.
2. **View Todos**: Below the input field, users can view a list of todos with options to mark them as completed or delete them.
3. **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark a todo task as completed, visually distinguishing it from incomplete tasks.
4. **Delete Todo**: Users can delete a todo task from the list.
5. **Data Persistence**: Redux Persist is employed to store todo data persistently, ensuring that todos are retained across sessions.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, providing type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **Redux Persist**: A library for persisting Redux state to storage.

Design of the app is based on the https://dribbble.com/shots/21947540-Simple-ToDo
